<h1>Keeping up with the Devops</h1>
                        <p>This cluster is meant as a personal learning experience to keep up with the development in IT when it comes to horizontal scaling and distributed data flows.</p>

<p>This video shows the experimental prototype with advanced features. The current "stable"/"public" version has no API for RGB-leds yet.</p>

<h2>The Goals</h2>

<p>As other people have already figured out, the small development boards are perfectly suited to experiment with clustered hard- and software. The tagline "Yet another&hellip;" is a nod towards their inspiration.</p>

<p>This project does hardly cover new ground. Nevertheless in a methodological way answers to inevitable questions are given:</p>

<p>One button to shut them all down!</p>

                    </section>

<h2>The Workflow</h2>

<p>A major milestone was reached when the formerly hackish cluster setup was fully automated to bootstrap up to 9 Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or Raspberry Pi 3 Model B into a networked cluster. All in a way to define the infrastructure in code and make remote execution within the cluster possible.</p>

The RSS feed informs about new content. If there is any wrong information: That qualifies as an issue on GitHub.</p>
